8ik, - white  


        eventually
          show live color bars in pygame as keys are pressed
          file browser to choose song
          seperate file browser to select previously created sequence
          ability to fade between colors by use to mod key(ctl, alt, shift..)
          strobe ability
          	off/color strobe simplest, but also complicated multi-color strobes

new todo:
	progress bar for song playback
		basically a line in a long rectangle that moves across the screen as the timestamp of the song increases
		look for a few different ways that people do this before choosing one
	under progress bar make 3 long empty rectangle bars
		these bars will be filled with rectangle bars as color keys are pressed
	button to open file browser for text file
