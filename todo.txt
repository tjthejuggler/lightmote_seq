          instead of printing letters, save them to a text file
          instead of letters, save the appropriate rgb codes based on letters pressed
          save song timestamps with rgb codes
              all in json format
                  {
                      10: [[255,0,0],[0,255,0],[0,255,0]],
                      22: [[255,0,0],[0,255,0],[0,255,0]],
                  }



			translates that keyboard input into lists which are associated with timestamps in a dict
				row 1 - ball 1
				row q - ball 2
				row a - ball 3
				row z - ball 4
					as we go across the row we have different rgb colors
						[255,0,0],[255,255,0],[0,255,0],[0,255,255].... (actually we will have more partial colors in beteen these)
		output is a text file json
			the same as the promgen_artists_formatted.txt

        eventually
          show live color bars in pygame as keys are pressed
          file browser to choose song
          seperate file browser to select previously created sequence
          ability to fade between colors by use to mod key(ctl, alt, shift..)
          strobe ability
          	off/color strobe simplest, but also complicated multi-color strobes

new todo:
	make pygame window larger(large width especially important)
	show song name at the top of the pygame window
		show song length
	button to open filebrowser for song (this button should be next to the song name)
	progress bar for song playback
		basically a line in a long rectangle that moves across the screen as the timestamp of the song increases
		look for a few different ways that people do this before choosing one
	under progress bar make 3 long empty rectangle bars
		these bars will be filled with rectangle bars as color keys are pressed
	button to open file browser for text file
