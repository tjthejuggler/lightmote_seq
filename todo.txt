eventually:
	we should be able to fade from one color to another using a modifier key like ctrl
    figure out how to use ctrl
  strobe ability
    off/color strobe simplest, but also complicated multi-color strobes






bug:
	when we load a text file and then add new key presses it doesnt save the original key colors
      when we load a text file immediately set our temporary dictionary to be the text file we loaded 
  if we save with no file name ın the dıalog it crash with load too probavlr
  when we press save file button its crashing if there is no name
  if we dont chose anything in save button its crushing
  if we havent done save as it crushes 

todo
	 line should move with mouse
    detect mouse down and print the xy coordinates of the curser(mouse)
    check the see if that xy is inside our line bar 
        if it is then move the line to that x position and music should play from the new time
   when we restart line should go to zero 
   we should have a pause for the music(we should change the space bar to pause music and stay at 
   current timestampt)
