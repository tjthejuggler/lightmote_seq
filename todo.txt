todo:
  test with real balls
  if a ball is already red and we make it red again, there should be some indication of this
    a little red line barely sticking out of the top covering the border
  clean code, remove prints, make functions when we can, fix variable names so they are like comments

bug


think about
  combıne mods for overwrıte strobe or maybe use right alt,ctrl
  a sliver of a color can get interjected into the middle of a fade, we dont want this, but what do we want
  the mode that is specifically for Disco Diffusion animation making
    gives printout or text file that can be copied and pasted into DD
    replace circles with an image that can show current state of animation
        would be awesome if this was hooked to some sort of real time small ai, but even an image with dynamic depth would be cool

pipe dreams
  hook up to some sort of music visualizer and make automatically
