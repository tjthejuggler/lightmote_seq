          instead of printing letters, save them to a text file
          instead of letters, save the appropriate rgb codes based on letters pressed
          save song timestamps with rgb codes
              all in json format
                  {
                      10: [[255,0,0],[0,255,0],[0,255,0]],
                      22: [[255,0,0],[0,255,0],[0,255,0]],
                  }



			translates that keyboard input into lists which are associated with timestamps in a dict
				row 1 - ball 1
				row q - ball 2
				row a - ball 3
				row z - ball 4
					as we go across the row we have different rgb colors
						[255,0,0],[255,255,0],[0,255,0],[0,255,255].... (actually we will have more partial colors in beteen these)
		output is a text file json
			the same as the promgen_artists_formatted.txt

        eventually
          show live color bars in pygame as keys are pressed
          file browser to choose song
          seperate file browser to select previously created sequence
