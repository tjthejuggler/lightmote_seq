hatice:
          ability to fade between colors by use to mod key(ctl, alt, shift..)
          strobe ability
          	off/color strobe simplest, but also complicated multi-color strobes

new todo:


	a button that restarts the program but just clear the colors gives us a new textfile
    close the current file and save if its not empty 
    stop the song 
    

	if text file is empty then dont create it delete or something


eventually:
	we should be able to fade from one color to another using a modifier key like ctrl
	figure out how we want to handle strobing

bug:
	when we load a text file and then add new key presses it doesnt save the original key colors
  if we save with no file name it crash


text input for filename with a save button
